When AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) creates a schema with the table name instead of converting tables, it could be due to a misconfiguration in the project or an unsupported schema structure between SQL Server and MySQL. Here’s how you can troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

### Steps to Resolve the Issue

1. **Check Schema Mapping in SCT**
   - Go to the SCT project settings and check the **schema mapping**. Make sure that the mapping aligns with your target MySQL schema structure.
   - Ensure that SCT is mapping your SQL Server schema to an actual schema name (like `dbo`) in MySQL rather than creating a new schema for each table.

2. **Review Source Database Structure**
   - Verify that your SQL Server database tables are organized under the expected schema (e.g., `dbo`). If the tables are outside of the default schema or have non-standard configurations, SCT may misinterpret them.

3. **Adjust the Target Schema Settings**
   - In SCT, click on the **Target Schema** settings for each table or schema and ensure that it’s set to create tables within the desired MySQL schema.
   - Double-check that the target schema is set to an existing schema name or a new schema name where you want the tables created (e.g., `employees` instead of defaulting to table names).

4. **Re-Run Schema Conversion**
   - After adjusting the schema mapping, re-run the **Convert Schema** action.
   - Review the generated schema in the SCT interface before applying it to MySQL to ensure it’s producing tables rather than individual schemas.

5. **Generate and Review SQL Script**
   - Rather than applying the schema directly, use SCT to **generate an SQL script** for the schema conversion.
   - Open the script and verify that it contains `CREATE TABLE` statements in the correct schema rather than `CREATE SCHEMA` statements with table names.
   - Manually adjust the script if needed before executing it on your MySQL database.

6. **Manual Adjustments if Necessary**
   - If SCT still misinterprets the schema, you can export the schema as SQL and manually edit it to remove any unintended `CREATE SCHEMA` statements.
   - Then, manually execute the corrected script in MySQL.

These steps should help guide SCT to convert your tables correctly.
