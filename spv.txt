Possible Causes for CDC Failures

1. Log Retention Issue:

If the transaction log has been truncated or overwritten before CDC processes the changes, it can cause failures.



2. Permission Problems:

The CDC process might lack the necessary permissions to access or process the logs.



3. Schema Changes:

Recent changes to the schema of the source tables (e.g., adding/dropping columns) may break the CDC process.



4. Capture/Job Agent Issues:

The CDC capture or cleanup jobs may have stopped or failed.



5. Metadata Corruption:

Corruption in CDC system tables or tracking metadata can cause failures.



6. Resource Constraints:

CDC may fail due to insufficient resources, such as memory or I/O capacity.



7. Configuration Issue:

CDC may not be properly configured on the source database or target system.

Troubleshooting Steps

1. Check Logs:

Review the CDC-specific logs and error details for more information about the failure.



2. Verify CDC Jobs:

Ensure the CDC jobs (capture and cleanup) are running successfully:

For SQL Server, check the SQL Server Agent jobs for CDC (e.g., cdc.<database_name>_capture).




3. Validate Log Retention:

Ensure the transaction log has sufficient retention to accommodate CDC.

Use the sys.sp_cdc_help_change_data_capture stored procedure to check log sequence number (LSN) ranges.

Increase log file size if needed.




4. Check Permissions:

Verify that the user account running the CDC process has:

Access to the transaction logs.

Appropriate database roles (e.g., db_owner or db_datareader).




5. Test with Manual Capture:

Run manual CDC queries to verify data capture:

SELECT * 
FROM cdc.fn_cdc_get_all_changes_<capture_instance>(@from_lsn, @to_lsn, 'all');



6. Monitor Schema Changes:

If schema changes occurred, recreate the CDC instance or resynchronize.



7. System Resource Check:

Verify there are no memory or disk I/O bottlenecks on the server.



8. Reinitialize CDC:

As a last resort, disable and re-enable CDC for the affected table or database:

EXEC sys.sp_cdc_disable_table @source_schema = 'schema_name', @source_name = 'table_name';
EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_table @source_schema = 'schema_name', @source_name = 'table_name', @role_name = NULL;

Specific Diagnostic Queries

Check CDC configuration:

SELECT * FROM sys.change_data_capture_tables;

Check for capture job errors:

EXEC sys.sp_cdc_help_jobs;

Verify LSN range:

SELECT * FROM sys.fn_cdc_get_max_lsn();
